I want to write an agent namely 'ocr.py' to read .png image files from subfolder namely 'png_output', it should read in the order of name page_0000.png, page_0001.png, page_0002.png until all the .png files are processed. The agent should extract the text in the image file into markdown format using pillow library, and output text should be appended into a single markdown file namely 'output.md'.  Do not change other code files other than 'ocr.py' and 'output.md'. Use python library from @pillow documentation.
